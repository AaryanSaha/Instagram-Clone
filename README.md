<h1>An Instagram Clone built with React</h1>
Jumping straight into it, this project was inspired by Rafeh Qazi and Sonny Sangha's streams on their Javascript course. This is a very basic representation of Instagram with some of it's features implemented in React and also with the help of Firebase' backend services.The app primarily includes the following features : 
  <li>Login and registration(using firebase authentication)</li>
  <li>A home page where users can see uploaded posts.</li>
  <li>A profile page where users can see their own posts. </li>
  <li>A section where user can add a post</li>
  
The posts uploaded by a user will be stored in firebase' cloud firestore.

<h3>Now, to get started</h3>
Simply clone the directory, and run "npm i". This will install all the dependencies from the project. Now since I cannot share my firebase credentials publicly, you have to add a seperate firebase file in your src folder. You can easily setup firebase for your project by referring to https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup or just google how to setup firebase for react and you'll find plenty of articles on this topic.

Once you have that set up, run npm start and you'll be able to run the project. There's a lot that I'm still not done with regarding this project. Someone could clone this and modify it according to their needs to make it better overall. 

Cheers!
